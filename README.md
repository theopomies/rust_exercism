# Rust Exercism

These are my [Exercism Rust Track](https://exercism.io/my/tracks/rust) solutions.

They are mainly stored for me to keep them, but also to serve as inspiration.

Feel free to contact me either through issues or comments on the solutions directly on Exercism as all solutions are public.

## Installation

Please refer to [Rust's website](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) and [Exercism's website](https://exercism.io/) to install the right tools.

## Structure

Each folder contains a problem/exercise detailed in it's `README`, `Cargo.toml` to install the right dependencies, a `tests` folder with _tests_ and a `lib.rs` file with my solution.
